# Cancer Diagnosis Machine Learning Project
This project involves the development of a machine learning model using Scikit-Learn and Python to diagnose whether a tumor is cancerous. The model is trained to classify tumors as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on their characteristics.

The machine learning model processes input parameters of a tumor and compares them with data from thousands of other tumors. By analyzing these comparisons, the model determines the likelihood of the tumor being malignant or benign.

In this system:

A malignant tumor is labeled as 'm'.
A benign tumor is labeled as 'b'.
This classification helps in providing a quick and efficient preliminary diagnosis, aiding in the early detection and treatment of cancer.
