# cancer-diagnosis
this is a cancer diagnosis machine learning project that i created to detect whether a tumor is cancerous or not. the machine learning model receives information or parameters of a tumor anbd it is able to match that information with thousands other tumors in order to dertermine if its cancerous or not. 
when a tumor is cancerous its said to be 'malignant' and when its not, its 'begnin'. so this model detects whether the tumors are begnin or malignant and these states are represented by the first letters in their names. for example if a tumor is malignant the model with return 'm'and 'b' for begnin.
